# Intro

Just playing around with Twitter API and Redis. You have to have a Redis server already running at `127.0.0.1:6379`.

## .env

Create the below .env file in root with your Twitter API credentials:
 
```JS
API=
API_SECRET=
BEARER_TOKEN=
ACCESS_TOKEN=
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1
```
